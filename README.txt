This workspace contains 4 major directories:

1. 'contracts': Holds three contracts with increasing levels of complexity.
2. 'scripts': Contains four typescript files to deploy a contract. It is explained below.
3. 'tests': Contains one Solidity test file for 'Ballot' contract & one JS test file for 'Storage' contract.
4. 'works': Conatins the smart contracts created by ME.
